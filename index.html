The notification is at the stage of public comments. The new notification is being brought in order to make the process more transparent and expedient by implementation of an online system, further delegation, rationalisation and standardisation of the process.<br /><br /><br />The new notification includes certain provisions which could end up diluting the EIA process, especially the public consultation aspect. It provides for a reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance. It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA. <br /><br />The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury. <br /><br />Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. As the Supreme Court has said in several judgements over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice. <br /><br />Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.<br /><br />Suggestion-- rather than compromise on the time needed for gathering public opinion, the government should focus on bringing down the average delay of 238 days in granting environmental clearance. In Kerala, the administration took 1,049 days to clear the construction of the IT park project of M/s T Tech Park Ltd, instead of 105 days.</p>',

The notification is at the stage of public comments. The new notification is being brought in order to make the process more transparent and expedient by implementation of an online system, further delegation, rationalisation and standardisation of the process.<br /><br />The new draft notification has some serious problems, one of which is the extension of the time given for submitting a compliance report throughout the term of the project. <br /><br />The earlier notification required that the project proponent submit a report every six months, showing that they are carrying out their activities as per the terms on which permission has been given. However, the new notification requires the promoter to submit a report only once every year. During this period, certain irreversible environmental, social or health consequences of the project could go unnoticed because of the extended reporting time. For example, if a mining project is being carried out at some place which can be potentially hazardous to the nearby population and can contaminate the air, and water nearby, a half-yearly compliance report would better help in addressing these concerns. Any hazardous activity can then be stopped through timely reporting.<br /><br />However, providing a longer period for filing reports can lead to disastrous consequences. In such a situation, the concerned authority will not have the opportunity to question the promoters for not following the terms of clearance. The only remedy would be to impose a fine or punishment; but that would not reverse the detrimental consequences on the environment.<br /><br />Suggestion-- Roll back on this increase in the period for filing compliance reports and decrease the period further to 4 months thus requiring the submission of 3 compliance reports every year.</p>',

We are deeply concerned that this draft notification has been put out in the midst of a national health crisis. As you are aware, most of the country is under lockdown and there are severe restrictions on movement in public places. Most offices are closed and staff are working from home. These restrictions may be indefinite and it is not clear when public life and work can resume.</p><p>The long-term public health, social and economic impacts of this global pandemic are yet to be ascertained. The EIA notification is an important regulation through which the impacts of land use change, water extraction, tree felling, pollution, waste and effluent management for industrial and infrastructure projects are to be studied and used in developmental decision-making. Any change in this law has a direct bearing on the living and working conditions of people and the ecology.</p><p>Therefore, it is critical that the government provides suitable and adequate opportunity for those impacted or likely to be affected by the design and implementation of EIA notification. Opportunities to understand and discuss the implications of the proposed amendments may be severely hindered due to the present health emergency with restricted public movement, social distancing and challenges to everyday life activities. These restrictions also make it impossible to disseminate information about the notification to communities who deserve to know and influence the notification.</p><p>We therefore request the environment ministry to:</p><ul><li>Immediately, withdraw the proposed amendments of the Draft EIA notification 2020.</li></ul><ul><li>Consider reissuing the draft only after health conditions related to Covid-19 and civic life is normalized across the country.</li></ul><ul><li>Ensure that there are wide spread and informed public discussions on the implication of these amendments.</li></ul><ul><li>A full disclosure of the nature of comments received and the reasons for acceptance and rejection of these comments, prior to the issuance of the final amendments.</li></ul><p>We do hope that the environment ministry will uphold its obligations towards informed public participation like the commitment to Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and also the Principles of Natural Justice, while taking a considered view on the proposed amendments to the EIA notification, 2020.</p><p>Sincerely</p><p>A Concerned Citizen</p><p>Copy to:</p><ul><li>Geeta Menon, Jt Secy, MoEFF (menong@cag.gov.in)</li></ul><p>Official email ID for responses to Draft EIA 2020: (eia2020-moefcc@gov.in)</p><p>sources:https://cprindia.org</p><p><br /><br /></p>',

The new notification includes certain provisions which could end up diluting the EIA process, especially the <strong>public consultation aspect.</strong> It provides for a <strong>reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance</strong>. <strong>It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification</strong>. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA.<br /><br />- The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. </div><div>- In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury.</div><div>- Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. <strong>The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. </strong>As the Supreme Court has said in several judgements over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice.<br />- Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. <strong>The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.</strong><br /><br />2. <strong>The project is allowed to start first and get an EIA clearance later.</strong> This will allow for unmonitored destruction of the environment and will pose a huge threat to the residing communities.</div><div>3. <strong>Loosened regulations: </strong>Rather than twice a year, the industries will have to now report compliance only once a year. Industries will be allowed to prepare reports themselves.

In turn, again destroying the environment, forests and wildlife. </div><div>5. <strong>Fines in place of criminal implications: </strong>Small fines in place of criminal implications will give a leeway for industries to continue with their violations and destruction of the environment and its resources by just paying a small fine. </div><div>6. <strong>No public participation for dams, mining and highway expansion: </strong>Such projects no doubt are essential for development but if the communities residing around them, or the forest and the wildlife surrounding the projects are being affected at alarming rates, there will not be any grievance redressal.

Industries will be allowed to prepare reports themselves. There are high chances for them taking any and all measures in the name of development that will destroy the already disrupted environment. </div><div>4. <strong>Clearance exemption: </strong>If the clearance exemption clause is still provided, communities that will be affected by coal mining, petrochemical plants, irrigation or waterway projects will no longer be able to report industrial violations.

If forests and wildlife are being affected by them, there will be no grievance redressal.</div><div>In conclusion, all these new norms give free and easy access to industries to damage our already affected environment, threatened forests and wildlife and takes away the rights of the vulnerable communities, forests or wildlife affected by them.

It provides for a reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance. It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA. <br /><br />The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury. <br /><br />Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. As the Supreme Court has said in several judgements over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice. <br /><br />Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains.

However, the new notification requires the promoter to submit a report only once every year. During this period, certain irreversible environmental, social or health consequences of the project could go unnoticed because of the extended reporting time. For example, if a mining project is being carried out at some place which can be potentially hazardous to the nearby population and can contaminate the air, and water nearby, a half-yearly compliance report would better help in addressing these concerns. Any hazardous activity can then be stopped through timely reporting.<br /><br />However, providing a longer period for filing reports can lead to disastrous consequences. In such a situation, the concerned authority will not have the opportunity to question the promoters for not following the terms of clearance.

Industries will be allowed to prepare reports themselves. There are high chances for them taking any and all measures in the name of development that will destroy the already disrupted environment. </div><div>4. <strong>Clearance exemption: </strong>If the clearance exemption clause is still provided, communities that will be affected by coal mining, petrochemical plants, irrigation or waterway projects will no longer be able to report industrial violations.

The new notification includes certain provisions which could end up diluting the EIA process, especially the <strong>public consultation aspect.</strong> It provides for a <strong>reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance</strong>. <strong>It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification</strong>. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA.<br /><br />- The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. </div><div>- In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury.</div><div>- Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. <strong>The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. </strong>As the Supreme Court has said in several judgements over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice.<br />- Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. <strong>The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.</strong><br /><br />2. <strong>The project is allowed to start first and get an EIA clearance later.</strong> This will allow for unmonitored destruction of the environment and will pose a huge threat to the residing communities.</div><div>3. <strong>Loosened regulations: </strong>Rather than twice a year, the industries will have to now report compliance only once a year. Industries will be allowed to prepare reports themselves. There are high chances for them taking any and all measures in the name of development that will destroy the already disrupted environment. </div><div>4. <strong>Clearance exemption: </strong>If the clearance exemption clause is still provided, communities that will be affected by coal mining, petrochemical plants, irrigation or waterway projects will no longer be able to report industrial violations. In turn, again destroying the environment, forests and wildlife. </div><div>5. <strong>Fines in place of criminal implications: </strong>Small fines in place of criminal implications will give a leeway for industries to continue with their violations and destruction of the environment and its resources by just paying a small fine. </div><div>6. <strong>No public participation for dams, mining and highway expansion: </strong>Such projects no doubt are essential for development but if the communities residing around them, or the forest and the wildlife surrounding the projects are being affected at alarming rates, there will not be any grievance redressal. It takes away the rights of vulnerable communities. If forests and wildlife are being affected by them, there will be no grievance redressal.</div><div>In conclusion, all these new norms give free and easy access to industries to damage our already affected environment, threatened forests and wildlife and takes away the rights of the vulnerable communities, forests or wildlife affected by them. In the wake of this pandemic, we should be more thoughtful and considerate about our environment .</div>Suggestion-- rather than compromise on the time needed for gathering public opinion, the government should focus on bringing down the average delay of 238 days in granting environmental clearance.

Any hazardous activity can then be stopped through timely reporting.<br /><br />However, providing a longer period for filing reports can lead to disastrous consequences.

For example, if a mining project is being carried out at some place which can be potentially hazardous to the nearby population and can contaminate the air, and water nearby, a half-yearly compliance report would better help in addressing these concerns. Any hazardous activity can then be stopped through timely reporting.<br /><br />However, providing a longer period for filing reports can lead to disastrous consequences. In such a situation, the concerned authority will not have the opportunity to question the promoters for not following the terms of clearance. The only remedy would be to impose a fine or punishment; but that would not reverse the detrimental consequences on the environment.<br /><br />Suggestion-- rather than compromise on the time needed for gathering public opinion, the government should focus on bringing down the average delay of 238 days in granting environmental clearance. In Kerala, the administration took 1,049 days to clear the construction of the IT park project of M/s T Tech Park Ltd, instead of 105 days.</p><p>The Earth Is What We Have In Common</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Concerned Earthling and Citizen of the Republic of India</p>',

Ltd., experienced a blowout on 27th May 2020 which was followed by a massive fire explosion on 9th June 2020 - all the while oil from the well continued to leak. </p><p>This disaster has opened our eyes to a history of exploitative and illegal practices adopted by OIL India Ltd. with the irrevocable support of MoEFCC.</p><p>There has undeniably been a <strong>huge loss of biodiversity, livelihoods, and oil reserves. </strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Biodiversity: </strong>Report (as per status of leak from 28th May 2020 to 2nd June 2020) by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) states that <em> “The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments, which will not only affect current life conditions, but due to sustained release over a long period, pose a serious health risk for a longer term “ </em></strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Livelihoods:</strong> While 50 houses have been burnt, several households are flooded with water mixed with oil condensate. Farms have been rendered useless for years to come and current cropland and livestock has been damaged. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Oil reserves: </strong>As per company report, cumulative production loss since May 27 due to bandhs and blockades has been <strong>5386 MT of crude oil </strong>and <strong>7.04 MMSCM of natural gas.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>The foremost question to be asked is: Could this disaster be prevented, and if a disaster is an unfortunate possibility then, could the impact of this disaster have been reduced?</strong></p><p>A disaster of this scale is attributed to not merely negligence of oil well operators on one day but to a history of negligence displayed by OIL India Ltd., MoEFCC and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Unless authorities from the aforementioned organisations accept their complicity to the disaster, more such disasters will happen in the future.</p><p>In an attempt to answer the question - whether the impact of the disaster could be reduced - we bring the following points to light: </p><ul><li><strong><strong>Oil and Natural gas exploration is an extremely complex practice. </strong></strong></li></ul><p>Several studies show that mishandling of such a plant could lead to the devastation of not only the local environment but also affect the global environmental conditions.</p><p>Given the risky nature of exploration and mining projects, the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) is expected to have a strict approach towards them, while the companies handling such projects are expected to have a sensitive approach towards the local communities and biodiversity.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>India currently faces a huge lack of expertise to deal with oil spills and related incidents.</strong></strong></li></ul><p>It is observed that India’s efforts to explore oil, mine coal etc. are placed in the best interest of the economy but such projects are not equipped with adequate facilities to deal with on-site accidents - as has been observed from previous oil spills in the country (major ones including Chennai(2016) and Sunderbans(2014)). The response work after the Baghjan incident appeared to be as inefficient as response work after the previous incidents. The disasters in the past decade had brought the need for a proper dissemination and management system to light, but compliance with these vital rules remains extremely low.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Baghjan incident is not Assam’s first encounter with an oil leak</strong></strong></li></ul><p>In 2012, oil leakage was reported from different localities in the Deohal area near the oil township Duliajan, Assam (India). The source was located in a gas reservoir in the Palaeogene sediments (Barail group) (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308969738_Gas_leakage_from_palaeogene_reservoir_in_Assam_-_a_geophysical_puzzle). Several local organisations had claimed that it was due to the illegal construction of the second pipeline which wreaked havoc in the Maguri-Beel wetland.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>History of ignoring concerns of local people</strong></strong></li></ul><p>A recent report from The Wire clearly states - “This ToR (Terms of Reference) required OIL to conduct a public hearing on the proposed site of the project. However, OIL requested the EAC (Expert Appraisal Committee) to exempt it from conducting a public hearing. The EAC obliged and the ToR was amended in February 2017 (http://environmentclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/Form-1A/Minutes/22032017KWOKFD7K20thEACMinutesofMeeting27-28February.pdf) to take out the requirement of public hearing. “</p><p>In addition to this, authorities have also failed to pay heed to the local public when they have protested against expansion of the excavation project in the past few years. Even in 2019, activists had demanded OIL India Ltd. to pause the work that they had initiated much before attaining a clearance letter from National Board of Wildlife (NBWL).</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Environmental clearance given to OIL India Ltd. dated 11th May 2020</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The environmental clearance accorded for Extension Drilling and Testing Hydrocarbons at seven locations under Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, Northwest of Baghjan PMLto OIL India Ltd. This decision came despite the close proximity of the oil well near Protected Areas which was vigorously protested against by local villagers.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Implications of clearances given through Zoom by MoEFCC, during COVID-19</strong></strong></li></ul><p>As per the <strong>Draft EIA Notification, 2020,</strong> “projects that have violated environment clearance norms will be given<strong> a chance for post-facto approvals</strong> as long as that project is permissible in the area. “ (https://india.mongabay.com/2020/04/government-pushes-for-post-facto-environment-clearances-while-apex-court-disapproves)</p><p><strong>The questions being posed against this notification by environmentalists should, at least now, seem well-founded, since the OIL project in Dibru-Saikhowa had also been seeking post-facto approval. </strong></p><p>Analysis of these details brings us to the conclusion that it is because of the gross violation of rules throughout the years of operation that have led to the exacerbation of the disaster that occurred on 27th May 2020. Even though previous such disasters have not led to a systemic change in which oil exploration projects are handled, the recent incident should not suffer the same fate as well. The scale of livelihood and biodiversity loss in the Dibru-Saikhowa region is frightening and it would be a humanitarian disaster if we let such disasters occur again, just to avoid accountability. </p><p>While we acknowledge the steps being taken for evacuation, restoration and compensation, it must be noted that all of this could be prevented had the company invested in precaution and conservation much before the incident. The non-negotiable demands from OIL India Ltd., MoEFCC, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>The evacuated villagers must immediately be shifted to shelter facilities with more space and better medical facilities. </strong></strong></li></ul><p><em>As per on-ground reports, the villagers have complained of inadequate facilities in shelter camp, hence providing them with better facilities should be a top priority.</em></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Strict action against OIL India Ltd. and withdrawal of Environmental Clearance (EC) given for Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) in Dibru-Saikhowa National Park</strong></strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Immediate steps to be taken to restore the habitats in and around Dibru Saikhowa National Park and Maguri Motapung Beel, as prescribed by WWF-India</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Immediate stop on all oil mining, drilling and exploration projects in the Dibru Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve in order to prevent any future damages to the inhabitants and the biodiversity of the area</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Explanation from OIL India Ltd. for not being equipped with appropriate facilities and expertise to prevent and mitigate such disasters</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Compensation accompanied by long-term rehabilitation of all affected villagers</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Withdrawal of the draft EIA notification 2020 and strict action against projects seeking post-facto approvals</strong></li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Regards,</p><p>A concerned citizen</p>' target="_blank">Baghjan OIL Blowout: Demand Action</a>
